Extract files and then navigate to the backend folder with a command line 
emulator and then open a browser and enter localhost:8080 for the url. I used 
Javascript, HTML, and CSS with no additional frameworks with front end code.
For the bcak end I used basic node.js functionality. At the moment there is no
real backend implementation, it is only used to serve the files and images.
All data on the front end has been mocked to show the intended functionality of
the application.
